# Microservices Communication in NestJS With gRPC

## Microservices and How they communicate 
Microservices communicate with each other in a variety of ways. As each microservice in a microservice architecture performs a specific function or task, communication is necessary to ensure the full application functions properly. Microservices architectures enable developers to create more flexible, scalable, and fault-tolerant applications due to the independent nature of each microservice. Additionally, microservices' modular design makes them idea for complex applications, as different system components may have varying demands and requirements.

## Challenges of Microservices Communication
Microservice often communicate with one another via well-defined APIs and protocols, allowing each microservice to do so reliably and effeciently. However, inter-microservice communication can be a little challenging and  tricky. Develoeprs could run into several problems when many microservices communicate with one another, including:
- **Latency**: caused by network congestion due to inefficient communication an data transfer.
- **Security**: potential vulnerabilities and threats could result from poor access control management or not bearing the necessary security protocols.
- **Service Discovery**: with an increase in the number of services in a system, it becomes difficult to manage and locate the appropriate service. Even worse, having hard-coded endpoints can lead to brittle systems.
- **Fault Tolerance**: with multiple services interacting with each other, any service failure can have a rippling effect on the entire system.

## Communication Patterns in Microservices
Microservices communicate with each other using various communication patterns. We will look at some of these: publish-subscribe, request-response, event-driven architecture, and message queuing.
- **Publish-Subscribe Pattern**: Involves one-to-many communication, where it publishes a message to multiple subscribers. For instance, a company sends out emails to its various newsletter subscribers.
- **Request-Response Pattern**: One service sends a request to another service, and the recipient service sends back a response. For instance, when an API receives a request and sends back the requested data or an error message in response.
- **Message Queuing Pattern**: In this pattern, messages are sent to a queue and stored until a service is available to process them. For example, a delivery company may use this pattern to receive and organize customer delivery requests and assign drivers as they become available based on their location.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: In this pattern, services exchange messages when events occur. For example, when a user sends money from their mobile banking app, the account update service receives a notification to deduct the amount.

## An overview of gRPC
gRPC is a high-performance, open-source remote procedure call (RPC) framework developed by Google. It enables a client application to invoke a method on a server application located on a remote machine with the same ease as calling a method on a local object. It simplifies the process of building and scaling distributed applications by providing efficient and language-independent communication between client and server applications.

## gRPC vs. REST vs. SOAP in Microservices
Communication protocols used in microservices architecture include gRPC, REST, and SOAP. Here some key differenes between them:
- **Language support**: REST and SOAP are commonly used with web-based programming languages, while gRPC supports wide range of programming languages, including C++, Java, Python and more.
- **Performance**: Because gRPC uses binary serialization, a compressed data format, and bidirectional streaming, it is quicker and more effective than REST and SOAP. As a result, client and server applications can communicate in real-time.
- **Data format**: REST n SOAP use XML or JSON, whereas gPRC uses Protocol Buffers, a binary serialization standard.
- **Strong typing and service contracts**: To establish service contracts, gRPC uses Protocol Buffers, which offer strong typing and aid in service versioning and maintenance. REST and SOAP use less expressive and flexible WSDL or OpenAPI difinitions for their service contracts.
- **Scalability**: gRPC is a superior option for microservices architecture because it is built to handle large-scale distributed systems and comes with capabilities like load balancing and health checking out of the box.
